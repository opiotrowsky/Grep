# Grep Unit Tests

### This branch was created to contain unit tests for MyGrep program. Tests are written in Catch2 framework, CMakeLists.txt attached to this branch compiles test.cpp file as well. The testing executable will be called MyGrep-ut after successful compilation.

The only way I know to compile using CMake is to create and enter build/ folder and type following commands:
```
cmake ..
make
```
